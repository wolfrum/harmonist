# Harmonist

**Discover Music Differently.**

Harmonist is an open-source music discovery platform designed to help listeners explore music through the real-world connections between artists ‚Äî not algorithms.

Rather than recommending music based on listening history or machine learning predictions, Rhythm & Ink reveals the influences, inspirations, and relationships that connect musicians across generations and genres.

Users can follow the rich web of artistic influence to uncover new artists, rediscover forgotten favorites, and deepen their appreciation for the interconnected history of music.

## ‚ú® What Harmonist Does

- **Explore Artist Networks:**  
  See visual network graphs of how artists are influenced by others, and who they themselves have influenced.

- **Discover by Genre:**  
  Browse artists grouped by broad parent genres (e.g., Punk, Blues, Rock), not narrow subgenres.

- **Follow Authentic Connections:**  
  Each artist connection is **human-curated** and **sourced from real interviews, articles, or videos** ‚Äî not AI guesses.

- **Complement Your Listening Journey:**  
  Every artist and album links directly to Spotify, so you can seamlessly dive into music you find interesting.

- **No Algorithms. No Echo Chambers.**  
  Rhythm & Ink is for listeners who want to go beyond what the algorithm thinks you‚Äôll like ‚Äî and instead **explore based on curiosity and influence**.

## üéØ Vision

At Harmonist, we believe that **music discovery should feel human**.  
Behind every artist is a tapestry of influences ‚Äî mentors, peers, and heroes.  
This app is designed to help people discover new music by following those real-world threads of influence, appreciation, and inspiration.

We aim to **celebrate musical heritage**, **encourage exploration**, and **help listeners find new favorites** outside of conventional recommendation loops.
