    <h2>About Harmonist</h2>
    <p>
      Harmonist is a music discovery platform designed to guide you beyond algorithmic recommendations.
      Instead of suggesting songs based on your past behavior, Harmonist helps you explore the web of artistic
      influence to discover real-life relationships between musicians that span genres,
      generations, and geographies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether youâ€™re a curious listener or a dedicated music explorer,
      Harmonist gives you the tools to trace the roots of sound and find
      something new that resonates. Follow who inspired your favorite artists,
      or see what kinds of music they love themselves. Each connection is backed
      by a sourced quote or interview.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harmonist is curated with care and built for the musically curious.
      We believe that discovering new music should feel more like flipping
      through vinyl at a record store than scrolling a feed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let influence be your compass. Skip the algorithm. Discover music differently.
